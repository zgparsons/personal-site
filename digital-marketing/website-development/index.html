    <h2>About Website Development</h2>
    <p>Included in this page is information about how websites work, and how they are created. Much of the information concerns the 'back-end' (the essential files, databases and technologies which websites rely on) of the website, rather than the
      'front-end' (the visual design of a site and aspects of the user interface).</p>
    <p>Topics such as relational databases and their uses, logic gates, basic programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and the key differences between them, and how server stacks work such as LAMP, WAMP and XAMPP.</p>

    <h2>Relational Databases</h2>
    <p><strong>What is a Database?</strong></p>
    <p>A database is a set of data which is stored by a computer. This data is usually stored in an organised or logical way, often with the aid of tables that are stored electronically on the computer or a server. Oftentimes there will be many different variables which affect how the data might be read or understood by a user (more about this later).</p>
    <p>A simple example of a database is below: (dummy data from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">here :)</a>)</p>
    <table title="Example">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Company</th>
          <th>Contact</th>
          <th>Country</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
          <td>Maria Anders</td>
          <td>Germany</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
          <td>Francisco Chang</td>
          <td>Mexico</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ernst Handel</td>
          <td>Roland Mendel</td>
          <td>Austria</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Island Trading</td>
          <td>Helen Bennett</td>
          <td>UK</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Laughing Bacchus Winecellars</td>
          <td>Yoshi Tannamuri</td>
          <td>Canada</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Magazzini Alimentari Riuniti</td>
          <td>Giovanni Rovelli</td>
          <td>Italy</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>In the above database we see some typical elements of a <i>flat-file</i> database. It is a series of columns and rows, in one table, organized in a tabular format. The columns are labelled: <i>Company</i> (a company name), <i>Contact</i> (the name of a contact within that company), and <i>Country</i> (the country in which the company, and contact, are based). As mentioned though databases can quickly become a lot more complex than this which is where <i>relational</i> databases come in.</p>
    <p><strong>What is a Relational Database?</strong></p>
    <p>When a database begins to use a more complex structure to allow users to identify and access data <i>in relation</i> to other pieces of data in the same database it becomes a relational database. To follow on from the example above, if the person using the database started to meet more than one contact from each company, and they also wanted to start including each contact's job title and/or role it might be helpful for them to begin to seperate out certain pieces of data in order for the information to be more helpful to them.</p>
    <p>If this person wanted to contact only the marketing departments of each company in their database, but knew that some of their contacts were from the operations (or HR, or any other departments), then being able to seperate out and access only the contacts from marketing departments would be a lot more helpful.</p>

    <p>This is an over-simplified example (because I'm too lazy to create or find more dummy data...), in fact you could even say that my example is pointless because so far it is unnecessary to seperate out that data ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, but it shows the concept well. Relational Databases have a <i>Primary Key</i>, which can be thought of as a unique identifier. A better example of this is below (and from the BBC Bitesize website), this example uses vehicles.</p>

    <p>The registration number acts as the primary key. So even if two cars have the same make, model and colour or other similar features, they will still never be confused with one another.</p>
