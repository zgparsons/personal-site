    <h2>About Website Development</h2>
    <p>Included in this page is information about how websites work, and how they are created. Much of the information concerns the 'back-end' (the essential files, databases and technologies which websites rely on) of the website, rather than the 'front-end' (the visual design of a site and aspects of the user interface).</p>
    <p>Topics such as relational databases and their uses, logic gates, basic programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and the key differences between them, and how server stacks work such as LAMP, WAMP and XAMPP.</p>

    <h2>Relational Databases</h2>
    <p><strong>What is a Database?</strong></p>
    <p>A database is a set of data which is stored by a computer. This data is usually stored in an organised or logical way, often with the aid of tables that are stored electronically on the computer or a server. Oftentimes there will be many different variables which affect how the data might be read or understood by a user.</p>
    <p>A simple example of a database would be:</p>
  <table title="Example">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Contact</th>
    <th>Country</th>
