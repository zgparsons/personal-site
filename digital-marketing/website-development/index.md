<h2>About Website Development</h2>
<p>Included in this page is information about how websites work, and how they are created. Much of the information concerns the 'back-end' (the essential files, databases and technologies which websites rely on) of the website, rather than the 'front-end' (the visual design of a site and aspects of the user interface).</p>
<p>Topics such as relational databases and their uses, logic gates, basic programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and the key differences between them, and how server stacks work such as LAMP, WAMP and XAMPP.</p>
