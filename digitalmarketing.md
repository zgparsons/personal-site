# Digital Marketing

<p>I am currently a Digital Marketing Apprentice. This page will cover all of the areas which are neccessary for me to learn.<br />
  The areas are broken up into Google Analytics and two 'Knowledge Modules', which contain the following:</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="4u 12u$(small)">
<h3><strong>Knowledge Module One: Principles of <code>coding</code></strong></h3>
<a href="km1/cms"><p>Content Management Systems</p></a>
<p>Website Development</p>
<p>Online Security & Data</p>
</div>
<div class="4u 12u$(small)">
<strong><h3>Knowledge Module Two: Principles of Marketing</h3></strong>
<p>The Business Environment</p>
<p>Sales, Segmentation & Strategy</p>
<p>Copywriting & Etiquette</p>
<p>Social Media Concepts & Branding</p>
<p>Paid SEO & Search Results</p>
</div>
<div class="4u 12u$(small)">
<strong><h3>Google Analytics</h3></strong>
<p>Beginners</p>
<p>Advanced</p>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<p>
As I add my notes about each section to this site, I will link each item to the relevant page.
</p>
Here is some general information about each section:

## Knowledge Module One

Knowledge Module One covers the 'Principles of Coding'. This means that it focuses on the tools which are predominantly used by Digital Marketers. Sections of learning in this module include 'Content Management Systems', 'Website Development' and 'Online Security & Data'.

## Knowledge Module Two

Knowledge Module Two covers the 'Principles of Marketing'. A larger module in scope than KM1, this module includes a wealth of vital information for any marketer. It includes 'The Business Environment', 'Sales, Segmentation & Strategy', 'Copywriting & Etiquette', 'Social Media Concepts & Branding' and 'Paid SEO & Search Results'.

## Google Analytics

Finally, as part of the learning process for Digital Marketers, at least one external course must be taken too. Google Analytics is the clear choice for this, because it is such a highly used, and powerful software. There is a 'Beginners' and an 'Advanced' section to be completed.
