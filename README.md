# Zachary Parsons - First Personal Website

This is the first website which I built to act as a portfolio / blog and to add projects which I had worked on to.

Since creating this site I have redesigned it and moved to [here instead](https://zacharyparsons.co.uk). Along with moving I have also written more posts, and created more projects.

You can see this original site here: https://zgparsons.github.io/personal-site/

To contact me, or ask anything about this site or any others you can write to me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/originalzedders).

😄🙏👨‍💻 Thanks!
