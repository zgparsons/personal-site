<h1>Computer Science</h1>

<h3>Ambitions</h3>
<p>Primarily I would like to continue learning about something which deeply interests me, Computer Science. My main ambition, which I believe would allow me to do this, is to have a full time job in software development, or something similar.</p>
<p>I enjoy creating websites, and have been using Wordpress to create personal sites or sites for friends and family members for years. However, I have always been aware that Wordpress is actually a layer of abstraction (a very handy one for creating websites), and have always been interested in learning more about the true processes involved in website creation and by extension the creation of apps and other software.</p>
<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/">This website</a> - Created in html, css and javascript (with some help from some trusty frameworks!) and served via Github pages using Jekyll.</li>
  <li><a href="/computer-science/cs50/">CS50</a></li>
  <li>CS50 Web</li>
</ul>
