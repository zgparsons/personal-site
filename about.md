# A little about me...

<p>...and my goals for this site</p>

<p>I'm a graduate in the UK, currently working for Surrey County Council as a Library Duty Manager (yes, a physical library - where people borrow books, and <a href="https://princh.com/activities-you-can-do-at-your-local-library-for-free/#.W_PxTuKYSUk">do all sorts of other things</a>!), and freelancing at <a href="https://webshape.uk">webshape.uk</a>.</p>

<p>I have always had an interest in computing, and in particular websites, I didn't study this at university but spend most of my free time learning new things (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman">watching coding challenges</a>...).</p>

<p>I love learning about Computer Science, and I am currently working through <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">CS50</a>, and a number of other freely available CS courses.</p>

<p>My goals for this site are for me to learn about HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am also using Github - it's hosted on Github Pages, which is free! It is also using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to serve the files. I have just started using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> as my editor of choice, previously I used <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> for a while, but have settled on VS for now.</p>

<p>I may use this site as a sort of portfolio for any projects which I do while learning about CS.</p>
