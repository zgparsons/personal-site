							<h4>What is a Content Management System?</h4>
							<p>A content management system is a software application that we use to publish digital content.
								Content can be added, updated and deleted via the CMS (and typically an easy to use User Interface, or UI) rather than via files.
								Website content will typically include text primarily, and then also embedded graphics, images & photos, videos, audio files, maps,
								and other applications (which use different types of program code), which will all be displayed to the user. A successful CMS must
								therefore be able to store and deliver all of these file types.</p>
							<p>According to user statistics (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">Wikipedia</a>) Wordpress is the most popularly used Content Management System.
								It is used by over 28% of all websites, and 59% of sites known to be using a CMS. Joomla and
								Drupal are two other market leaders. There are many others available too. More recently, and increasingly, some CMS systems also contain
								'Drag and Drop' interfaces. An example of this is Weebly. They can be easier to use for people with less experience in website creation,
								however they can also be a bit limited in the possibilities available.</p>
							<p>Weebly is also a good example of a free (or almost free) CMS. If you are happy for Weebly to host your website (which might include them advertising),
								and if you do not mind having a weebly domain name, rather than a custom one, it is a free service. (More about both website hosting and domain names later on...)</p>

								<li>+</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-6-medium">
							<strong><h4>CMS Advantages & Disadvantages Compared to Static Websites</h4></strong>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>No need to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript etc.</li>
								<li>Usually there is version control built into CMS</li>
								<li>CMS allows for different levels of editing permissions</li>

								<li>+</li>
								<li></li>
								<li>CMS may have limited ability to create functionality not originally envisioned by the CMS creator</li>

								<li>+</li>
							</ul>

							<strong><h4>What is Web Hosting?</h4></strong>
							<p>The files which make up a website need to be stored somewhere, and where they are stored needs to be accessible
								to all via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>.</p>
							<p>Web hosting companies provide a range of different solutions for this. Essentially each solution offers some physical
								computing space which has internet connectivity (often this means space on a remote server) where the files of a website are uploaded to and stored.</p>
							<p>These hosting companies are not the only option though. It is possible to host your own website files. There are some advantages and
								disadvantages to both of these options:</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-3 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<h4>Advantages of Self Hosting</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Control</li>
								<li>Ability to back-up and access files more freely</li>
								<li>Manage your own database</li>
								<li>Manage your own hardware</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="col-3 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<h4>Disadvantages of Self Hosting</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Site might not be scalable</li>
								<li>Spikes of traffic might cause site to go down</li>
								<li>Personal ability is being relied on</li>
								<li>May be expensive equipment and internet costs</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="col-3 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<h4>Advantages of Hosted Services</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Managed servers generally provide speed</li>
								<li>Security â€“ Practically hacker proof</li>
								<li>Expert support</li>
								<li>Daily back ups</li>
								<li>Automatic updates</li>
								<li>No downtime</li>
								<li>Accessible developer tools</li>
								<li>Scalable</li>
								<li>Will cope with high band widths</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="col-3 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<h4>Disadvantages of Hosted Services</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Expensive</li>
								<li>Lack of control</li>
								<li>Delays in getting things done?</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
							<h4>Free Web Hosting?</h4>
							<p>Yes, there is also versions of free hosting available which sounds great,
								but does have some key disadvantages. They are in fact free, but for example
								it will most likely have advertising, you will be unable to use a custom domain name,
								and there will be no direct support, and it is unlikely there will be very responsive
								forum support. You may also see limitations to the bandwidth and speed available to your files.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
							<strong><h4>What is a Domain Name?</h4></strong>
							<p>Domain Name System, DNS, is a friendly naming system for giving addresses to web servers and web pages.
								To access a website, you need to give your browser some information - the main part of this information
								is the location where the website files are stored. This information is given as an IP address, which looks like this:
								172.16.254.1 in IPv4, and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 in IPv6 (copy/pasted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">Wiki</a>).
								Essentially the Domain hides the IP address, and makes it easier for hoomans to recognise/understand.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Top level domain = .co.uk / .com / .gov.uk / etc.</li>
								<li>Mid level = eg. Facebook / surreycc / zacharyparsons</li>
								<li>Machine name = www.</li>
							</ol>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
							<strong><h4>Why Have a Website?</h4></strong>
							<p>Certainly in terms of Digital Marketing, the main audience that you are expecting is the customer.</p>
							<p>With this in mind, the company's website can spill into each 'P' in the marketing mix (laid out below, but more about that in KM2).</p>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>Place - Product should be available where your target audience can find it easiest.</li>
								<li>Promotion - Advertising and PR.</li>
								<li>Price - Should represent good value for money.</li>
								<li>Product - Should fit the task which consumers want it for.</li>
								<li>Processes - The delivery of your product or service is done with the customer present, how the service is delivered is part of what the consumer is paying for.</li>
								<li>People - Companies are reliant on the people who run them - front line to MD.</li>
								<li>Physical Evidence - Almost all services include some physical elements even if the bulk of the product is intangible.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The purposes of a website are:</p>
							<p>To be found | To build relationships | To be an ecommerce platform | To offer a service or information | To offer entertainment | Blogs & updates</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
							<h4>The Importance of User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI)</h4>
							<p>The User Interface, or the UI, governs the User Experience, or the UX.
								The website should be created with the user in mind primarily.
								Important things include having a simple navigation system, 
								analysing bounce rates, and ensuring the site meets accessibility 
								standards.</p>
							<p>Having a simple navigation will make the website easy to understand for new visitors 
								(who might also be new customers), it will help existing customers feel comfortable (and hopefully help to retain them), 
								and it will hopefully limit the number of bounces...</p>
							<p>The bounce rate is the percentage of visitors to a particular website who navigate away 
								after only a few seconds.</p>
							<p>Examples of good and bad bounce rates:</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>26 - 40% | V. good</li>
								<li>41 - 55% | Still good</li>
								<li>56 - 70% | Hmmm...</li>
								<li>70% + | Need to make some changes to UI</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
							<h4>What is Web Accessibility?</h4>
							<p>Accessibility on the web is about removing barriers that prevent interaction 
								with, or access to, websites by people with disabilities.</p>
							<p>For example, for some people to view websites might be more difficult, but 
								it can be a key source (sometimes the only source) of information available.
								For people with visual impairments, motor/mobility difficulties, inability to use hands, 
								deafness or hearing impairments, types of seizures, or developmental/learning/cognitive 
								disabilities, it is important to make the web as accessible as possible.</p>
							<p><a href="http://wave.webaim.org">This website</a> gives a full report on how accessible a 
								website is, and any issues which it might have.</p>
							<p>The Equality Act 2010 states that a website owner must make sure that their website 
								can be accessed by people with disabilities.</p>
