							<h2>Knowledge Module One</h2>
							<strong><h3 id="cms">Content Management Systems</h3></strong>
							<h4>What is a Content Management System?</h4>
							<p>A content management system is a software application that we use to publish digital content.
								Content can be added, updated and deleted via the CMS (and typically an easy to use User Interface, or UI) rather than via files.
								Website content will typically include text primarily, and then also embedded graphics, images & photos, videos, audio files, maps,
								and other applications (which use different types of program code), which will all be displayed to the user. A successful CMS must 
								therefore be able to store and deliver all of these file types.</p>
							<p>According to user statistics (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">Wikipedia</a>) Wordpress is the most popularly used Content Management System.
								It is used by over 28% of all websites, and 59% of sites known to be using a CMS. Joomla and
								Drupal are two other market leaders. There are many others available too. More recently, and increasingly, some CMS systems also contain 
								'Drag and Drop' interfaces. An example of this is Weebly. They can be easier to use for people with less experience in website creation, 
								however they can also be a bit limited in the possibilities available.</p>
							<p>Weebly is also a good example of a free (or almost free) CMS. If you are happy for Weebly to host your website (which might include them advertising), 
								and if you do not mind having a weebly domain name, rather than a custom one, it is a free service. (More about both website hosting and domain names later on...)</p>

							<strong><h4>Common Features of CMS</h4></strong>
							<ul class="alt">

								<li>SEO-Friendly URL structuring</li>
								<li>Shared resources</li>
								<li>Regular updates - features & security</li>
								<li>Mobile ready</li>
								<li>Archive capabilities</li>
								<li>Database driven</li>
								<li>Remote access</li>

								<li>Easy to link to CRM (or ecommerce, or other) systems</li>
								<li>+</li>

							<strong><h4>CMS Advantages & Disadvantages Compared to Static Websites</h4></strong>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>No need to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript etc.</li>
								<li>Usually there is version control built into CMS</li>
								<li>CMS allows for different levels of editing permissions</li>
								<li>Can be easier to create a unified look & feel, via using themes & plugins</li>
								<li>Added functionality is usually a lot easier to integrate</li>
								<li>CMS will have a WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) editor</li>
								<li>+</li>
								<li></li>
								<li>CMS may have limited ability to create functionality not originally envisioned by the CMS creator</li>
								<li>A CMS may increase the need for special expertise or specific training for content creators/authors</li>
								<li>+</li>

						<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
							<h4>What is Web Hosting?</h4>
							<p>The files which make up a website need to be stored somewhere, and where they are stored needs to be accessible
								to all via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>.</p>
							<p>Web hosting companies provide a range of different solutions for this. Essentially each solution offers some physical 
								computing space which has internet connectivity (often this means space on a remote server) where the files of a website are uploaded to and stored.</p>
							<p>These hosting companies are not the only option though. It is possible to host your own website files. There are some advantages and 
								disadvantages to both of these options:</p>
